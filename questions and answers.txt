Questions:

1. what are your goals from this or what do you want to contribute / want out of working on vyxal?
  - is it just to have some fun with a casual project?
  - help lyxal out with making their language?
  get some experience (whether or not it's necessarily helpful for either future projects or future professional things)? etc.
2. what do you want the vyxal project and development team to be like?
  - more of a casual gathering, like a group of friends, working on a fun idea together?
  - an organized team working to create a project (of course that doesn't mean there's no fun or that it's anything close to a company structure - we don't need to have any hierarchy and can just be a couple of fellow CGCCers working on a thing but still be organized)? etc.

1. All of these, honestly. Vyxal is fun despite the frequent fires (often caused by me :P), y'all are great, and I get a little practice with Git, GitHub, testing, stuff like that
2. More of a casual gathering - we need a bit of organization, but no real hierarchy (except for lyxal basically having a veto on major decisions, since it's their language)
